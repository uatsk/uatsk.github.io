            <h2>Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs)</h2>
            <p>
                An IRDC is a dense, cold region of gas and dust in the 
                interstellar medium that appears dark against the 
                bright infrared background of the Milky Way. 
                These clouds are cold (typically around 10-20 K) and dense 
                (gas number densities ~10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> which is 
                much higher than the average interstellar medium), and
                contain large amounts of dust that absorb and block background 
                infrared light, causing them to appear as dark silhouettes in 
                infrared images (e.g., from the Spitzer Space Telescope).
                <figure>

                </figure>
                IRDCs are ideal birthplaces of massive stars and star clusters 
                because their high densities and low temperatures allow gravity 
                to overcome internal pressure, leading to gravitational collapse 
                and star formation. In particular, the large mass reservoir in IRDC
                favors the formation of high-mass stars (more than 8 solar masses) 
                which are rare and short-lived but critically influence galactic evolution.
                Therefore, observing star-forming activities in IRDCs will improve
                our understanding of the physical process of massive star formation.

            <p>
                I have been studying star formation in distant IRDCs using interferometers
                at mm/sub-mm wavelengths. These wavelengths contain dust continuum emission 
                and molecular line emission that can penetrate the thick gas and dust
                that obscure the cloud at shorter wavelengths.

                Using the <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/" target="_blank">
                    Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)</a>, 
                    I have mapped the IRDC G28 in the 1.3 mm dust continuum along 
                    with multiple molecular line emissions. In the figure above, 
                    the green color represents dust emission, which traces the 
                    dense cores deeply embedded within the cloud. These cores are 
                    localized regions of high density where individual stars or 
                    multiple systems are formed. As shown, the dense cores align 
                    well with the dark lane seen in the infrared emission. 
                    This alignment reveals that although this IRDC appears quiescent, 
                    it is actively forming a cluster of stars.

                    Star formation activity is further evidenced by CO molecular 
                    outflows. In the figure, the blueshifted and redshifted 
                    high-velocity CO gas forms bipolar outflows originating 
                    from the dense cores, indicating ongoing accretion onto 
                    central protostars. These protostars will continue accreting 
                    material from their surroundings until they eventually expel 
                    the remaining gas, unveiling themselves as a nascent star 
                    cluster. The expelled gas will return to the interstellar 
                    medium, feeding the next cycle of molecular cloud and star formation.

                    <br>
                    With the ALMA data, I studied the core mass distribution in G28,
                    showing a shallower core mass function (CMF) than the typical 
                    stellar initial mass function (IMF). Similar results were seen in 
                    other massive star-forming regions (e.g., 
                    the <a href="https://www.almaimf.com/" target="_blank">
                        ALMA-IMF Large Program</a>). Either the CMF has little
                    effect on the final IMF, or additional physics is needed to
                    explain the slope change. The results were reported in 
                    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaffd5" target="_blank">Kong (2019), ApJ, 873, 31</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By examining the outflows in G28, one can see that they are 
                    roughly orthogonal to the filamentary dark lanes. To investigate 
                    this further, I conducted a statistical analysis of the relative 
                    orientation between the outflows and the filaments, which I presented in 
                    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab07b9" target="_blank">Kong et al. (2019), ApJ, 874, 104</a>.
                    The result shows that the relative orientation tends to be close to
                    90 degree, suggesting the presence of a large-scale physical mechanism 
                    that maintains this alignment. Such a mechanism could be closely related to, 
                    or even responsible for, the formation of the cloud itself.

                    Using the CO outflow data, one can distinguish between cores with and 
                    without signs of star formation, at least to some extent. Assuming that 
                    cores exhibiting outflows are more evolved than those without, 
                    comparing the two types can reveal whether core mass increases over time. 
                    In <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abefe7" target="_blank">Kong et al. (2021), ApJ, 912, 156</a>,
                    I conducted a statistical test of the core masses and found that 
                    protostellar cores tend to be more massive than starless ones. 
                    This result suggests that dense cores are not static in mass but 
                    instead actively interact with their surroundings by continuing to accrete material.

                            From top-left to lower-left clockwise, the figure gradually
                            zooms in to show the hierarchical structure of a dense core 
                            and the embedded binary. The core is at the southern end of G28.
                            See <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acd252" target="_blank">Kong et al. (2023), ApJ, 950, 187</a> for details.

                    Using the ALMA C9 array configuration, we observed the massive dense core 
                    C1-S1 located at the southern end of G28. This region exhibits the highest extinction 
                    (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/829/1/L19" target="_blank">Lim et al. (2016), ApJL, 829, 19</a>)
                    in the cloud, which is why we pay particular attention on it. 
                    Given its substantial mass reservoir, C1-S1 is a strong candidate 
                    for forming a massive star. The C9 configuration offers ALMA's second-highest 
                    spatial resolution in Band 6 (~0.02", or about 100 AU), 
                    enabling us to resolve fine structural details. 
                    Thanks to ALMA's exceptional sensitivity, we were able to witness 
                    the formation of a binary system within the massive C1-S1 core. 
                    This discovery aligns with current understanding that massive stars 
                    almost always form in binary or multiple systems. Remarkably, 
                    our observations capture the initial stages of such a system, 
                    providing critical constraints on theories of massive star formation.
                    The results were reported in
