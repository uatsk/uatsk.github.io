            <h2>The Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection mechanism</h2>
            <p>I am interested in molecular cloud and star formation.
                Most recently, I am focusing on understanding the role
                of magnetic fields in the interstellar medium (ISM) 
                through a combination of observational and theoretical 
                approaches. The ISM, a major constituent of the Galaxy 
                and an active participant in the baryon cycle, is 
                essentially a plasma that is threaded with magnetic fields. 
                As such, understanding the interplay between magnetic fields 
                and the ISM is crucial. Traditional studies have often 
                emphasized the resistance of magnetic fields to gas 
                condensation, portraying them as playing a primarily 
                passive role. This view is part of the reason that 
                magnetic fields were thought to be secondary in star 
                formation and galaxy evolution. To expand this perspective, 
                I take a different approach by exploring an active role 
                of magnetic fields. Specifically, by modeling the novel 
                <b>Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection (CMR)</b>
                mechanism, I show that magnetic fields can actively condense 
                interstellar gas into star-forming clouds. The new model, 
                firmly based on observational motivations, suggests that 
                magnetic fields can be dynamically decisive, offering a 
                missing piece in our understanding of the interplay
                between magnetic fields and the ISM.

                            Two spherical clouds collide (or any other shape, here I use spheres 
                            for simplicity) at the interface between reverse magnetic fields.
                            Black arrows indicate initial magnetic fields (with only z-components):
                            B<sub>1,z</sub> > 0 (for x<0) and B<sub>2,z</sub> < 0 (for x>0).
                            The cartesian coordinate system axes are illustrated at lower-left.
                            The point of collision is at the origin (the colliding clouds
                            can be separated initially).
                            The idea is to have colliding flows/clouds bring reverse fields 
                            from afar to trigger magnetic reconnection.
                            Collision velocities along the x-axis are v<sub>1,x</sub> > 0 and
                            v<sub>2,x</sub> < 0. The CMR filament forms along the y-axis
                            through the origin (see movie on the right).

                            magnetic fields near the collision midplane (x=0).
                            Initially a pancake structure is formed in the 
                            middle. Soon, reconnection of fields on two sides 
                            of the pancake happens, forming field loops that 
                            encircle the pancake. Due to magnetic tension,
                            the field loops pinch the pancake, pulling gas
                            toward the central axis. As a result, a filament
                            forms along the central axis.

                The simulation data is from the fiducial model MRCOL
                from <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abc687"

                in which I proposed CMR for the first time to explain the formation
                of the Stick filament in the Orion A giant molecular cloud.
                As the collision continues along x-axis, more 
                dense gas forms in the pancake (y-z plane or the 
                collision midplane) which is continuously 
                transported to the central filament. At the end, 
                helical fields wrap around the filament with 
                confining surface pressure. Formation of 
                dense cores and stars shall follow in the filament.

                While going through the <a href="research-carmaorion.html" target="_blank">CARMA-NRO</a>
                survey C<sup>18</sup>O data cube, I noticed a special filament (the Stick) at the 
                southern end of the integral-shaped filament. It shows ring-like fibers at different 
                velocity channels (see left column in the figure below). 
                These ring-like fibers resemble those structures 
                in magnetic reconnection simulations, which motivated me to model the filament formation 
                in the context of magnetic reconnection. To my surprise, the 15-year-long effort by
                Dr. Carl Heiles who observed the HI Zeeman effect 
                (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/313010" target="_blank">Heiles (1997), ApJS, 111, 245</a>)
                showed a reverse magnetic field on two sides of the Orion A cloud.
                This field-reversal is a necessary condition for CMR.
                Considering other observational facts such as the double-velocity spectral feature and
                the perpendicular plane-of-the-sky magnetic fields 
                (e.g., <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa35779-19/aa35779-19.html" target="_blank">Soler (2019), A&A, 629, 96</a>),
                the only initial condition for the model is a setup like the right panel in the figure below.
                So I used the <a href="https://www.athena-astro.app" target="_blank">Athena++</a> code 
                to set up a collision simulation between two spherical diffuse clouds (we always start
                with spheres:) with reverse magnetic fields (see the left panel in the top figure).

                Surprisingly, instead of forming a compressed “pancake” structure, 
                the collision resulted in the formation of a filament. This outcome 
                contrasts with the intuitive expectation that a head-on collision 
                between two spherical bodies would simply create a flattened 
                structure at the center. However, a closer examination of a 
                simulation slice revealed that a pancake did initially form. 
                Soon after, it became wrapped by magnetic field loops, which 
                exerted strong tension and gradually squeezed the pancake material 
                toward the central axis, forming the filament. In other words,
                <b>the filament formation does not need gravity!</b>
                Although, gravity will take over with the growth of the 
                filament mass, as long as the cloud collision continues.

                The figure below illustrates the formation of these magnetic loops. 
                The collision triggered magnetic reconnection on both sides of the 
                pancake, generating two half-loops and a full loop. The half-loops 
                pulled gas outward, while the full loop compressed the pancake inward. 
                As the collision progressed, ongoing reconnection continuously 
                funneled dense gas into the central filament. This dynamic process 
                is shown in the movie in the top figure.

                    It shows how the collision compresses the reverse field

                    the collision midplane (x=0). Magnetic tension of the 
                    reconnected field squeezes the pancake to z=0, resulting
                    in a filament along the y-axis.

                Using the model filament, I performed synthetic observations
                and compared the resulting radiative transfer images with 
                actual observational data. The model showed strong agreement 
                with observed features, including the column density distribution, 
                the position-velocity diagram, and overall morphological 
                characteristics. Notably, it provided a natural explanation 
                for the observed reversed magnetic field. An intriguing 
                implication emerged from this analysis: the structures within 
                the CMR filament appear to be confined by surface magnetic 
                pressure. This finding aligns with the conclusion of 
                <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa8631" target="_blank">Kirk et al. (2017)</a>, 
                which suggests that dense cores in Orion are primarily pressure-confined.

                To investigate whether a filament like the Stick can form stars,
                we used the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15715.x" target="_blank">Arepo</a>
                code with sink formation to repeat the above Athena++ simulation.
                First, the filament formation was reproduced in the Arepo simulation,
                so that CMR was independently confirmed with a different code.
                Second, the filament collapsed and formed a star cluster,
                but only after the filament became massive enough.
                An intriguing finding was that the star formation rate in CMR
                was a factor of two lower than a control model without CMR.
                The lower rate was due to the surface magnetic field that 
                acted like a shield and hindered gas inflow. 
                The result was reported in
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac2932" target="_blank">Kong et al. (2022), MNRAS, 517, 4679</a>.

                I led a brief parameter exploration of CMR to see how different
                initial conditions affect the filament property.
                Again, I used Athena++ for the simulations, following the 2021 Stick paper.
                A notable finding was that a curved filament would form if 
                the initial colliding clouds have different radii or different density.

                Using the exploration data, Dr. Duo Xu utilized machine-learning techniques
                to capture the morphological features of CMR filaments.
                Then, we applied the machine-learning models to the

                far infrared images of several filamentary clouds, including the Taurus cloud,
                the Orion cloud, and the Auriga–California Cloud. Several filamentary structures 
                of these clouds were identified as CMR filaments. The findings were reported in

                Notably, these clouds were reported to have reverse magnetic fields

                The MRCOL simulation began with molecular gas collision. 
                A natural follow-up question is whether collisions between atomic gas 
                can also lead to molecular cloud formation. In  
                <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad73a5" target="_blank">Kong et al. (2024), ApJ, 975, 97</a>,
                we used Arepo again to model CMR within the cold neutral medium (CNM). 
                The results showed that a filamentary molecular cloud successfully formed. 
                This cloud exhibited numerous fiber-like substructures, with sinks 
                actively accreting material through streamers. Recall from 
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac2932" target="_blank">Kong et al. (2022)</a>,
                that sink accretion was only possible through streamers, 
                as surface magnetic fields inhibited free gas inflow. 
                Remarkably, this behavior persisted at a much larger scale (20 pc), 
                with all sinks in the molecular cloud accreting via streamers.
                Most notably, the molecular cloud was naturally turbulent, 
                driven by reconnected magnetic fields that funneled gas into the filament 
                at supersonic (Alfvénic) speeds. This process compressed and transported 
                shocked gas into the filament in a piece-by-piece manner. Consequently, 
                <b>filament formation in this scenario follows a bottom-up process</b> -- 
                distinct from the traditional top-down view of star formation, 
                where gravity collects diffuse gas into a molecular cloud, 
                which then collapses and fragments into clumps and cores. 
                Remember, CMR filament formation proceeds without the need for gravity.

                I also explored CMR in warm neutral medium in a disk galaxy.
