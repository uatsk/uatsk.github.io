            <h2>The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO)</h2>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://aro.as.arizona.edu" target="_blank">Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO)</a>
                is a research facility 
                dedicated to radio astronomy, operated by the Steward Observatory 
                at the University of Arizona in Tucson. ARO manages two key 
                radio telescopes: the 12-meter Telescope on Kitt Peak and 
                the Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) on Mount Graham. 
                These instruments are used to observe the universe at 
                millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths, allowing astronomers 
                to study cold, dense regions of space where stars and planets form.
                ARO has been at the forefront of molecular astrophysics, 
                enabling the discovery and analysis of complex molecules 
                in interstellar space, the structure of molecular clouds, 
                star formation processes, and galactic dynamics. 
                Notably, ARO has been part of the
                <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org" target="_blank">Event Horizon Telescope</a>
                that maps supermassive black holes (see the press release 
                <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/press-release-april-10-2019-astronomers-capture-first-image-black-hole">M87</a>).
                The observatory serves as a critical training ground 
                for students and researchers in astrophysics.

                In <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0a8f" target="_blank">Baade et al. (2024), ApJ, 960, 33</a>,
                our previous undergraduate student Jonah Baade led a study of the molecular gas 
                in the Cygnus-X molecular cloud complex. We present new observations of the 
                southern Cygnus-X complex using CO(2-1) and <sup>13</sup>CO(2-1) emission lines, 
                obtained with the SMT. This region is heavily influenced by stellar feedback 
                from the nearby Cygnus OB2 association. To investigate the <b>volume density</b> 
                structure of the molecular gas, we combined our SMT maps with existing CO(1-0) 
                and <sup>13</sup>CO(1-0) data from the <a href="https://cygnus45.github.io" target="_blank">
                Nobeyama 45-meter Cygnus-X CO Survey</a>. 
                We applied excitation modeling using <a href="https://var.sron.nl/radex/radex.php" target="_blank">RADEX</a>
                to estimate local physical conditions and gas densities across the region.
                <br>
                <br>
                Jonah identified velocity-coherent components within the data, 
                particularly those associated with the high-density structures. 
                These selected structures were used to construct an empirical volume density 
                probability distribution function (ρ-PDF), representing 
                the distribution of gas volume densities in Cygnus-X. The resulting ρ-PDF 
                followed a power-law form, spanning densities between 10<sup>4.5</sup> and 
                10<sup>5.5</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, with a best-fit slope of α = -1.12 ± 0.05.
                This slope is notably shallower than predicted by models of gravitational 
                collapse or rotationally supported cloud structures, which typically yield 
                steeper density distributions. We interpret this as a possible 
                signature of stellar feedback -- likely from Cygnus OB2 -- disrupting or reshaping 
                the gas and injecting turbulence into the cloud.

                The study provides an important empirical constraint on the internal 
                structure of molecular clouds under the influence of stellar feedback. 
                The derived ρ-PDF offers a critical benchmark for testing theoretical models 
                and numerical simulations of cloud evolution, particularly those aiming to 
                reproduce observed density distributions in environments subject to intense 
                radiative and mechanical feedback. Matching this 
                observed shallow ρ-PDF in future simulations will be key to identifying the 
                physical mechanisms driving star formation in such complex regions.
